# NumPy Learning Resources 📘

This repository contains all the **NumPy resources** I’ve collected and used for learning.  
The materials are organized into folders based on their source:

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **Folder 1** → From *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas  
- **Folder 2** → From *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron  
- **Folder 3** → From *Krish Naik’s Machine Learning Course*  

## 🔄 Updates
I’ll keep updating this repository whenever I come across better or more useful resources.  
These are the ones I’ve used so far in my NumPy learning journey.
